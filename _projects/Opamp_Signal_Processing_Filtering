title: "Op-Amp Based Audio Noise Suppression Using a 3rd-Order Chebyshev Band-Stop Filter"
description: "Design and hardware implementation of a 3rd-order active Chebyshev band-stop filter for targeted audio noise suppression. The filter was designed around operational amplifiers and validated through LTspice simulation, Bode and frequency-response analysis, and physical breadboard testing. The implemented circuit achieved approximately 10 dB attenuation at the target frequency of 5 kHz while preserving overall signal amplitude and minimising distortion outside the stopband."
