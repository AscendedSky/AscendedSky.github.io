title: "Design of a 12U Lunar Cubesat"
description: "Engineering design of a 12U Lunar Cubesat for a polar lunar orbit mission targeting volatile mapping in near-PSRs and penumbras. The project followed a structured workflow from system-level ConOps, AI-based payload planning, power budget analysis, to CAD modeling of a scaled 2U prototype. This project was submitted to the International Space Challenge and was selected for showcase display during the event."

### More Details

My role in this project was to develop a 12U Lunar Cubesat following a structured engineering process. I started by defining the overall system flow and concept of operations, mapping out all subsystems, data paths, and operational sequences to create a clear blueprint for the mission, without considering assumptions such as prioritization and preemption between downlink and imaging events, maximum allowable downlink delay, or daily/orbit spectral cube generation, as these were issues that the proposed AI framework was meant to resolve.

Next, an AI-based framework was proposed to handle spectrometer calibration-drift correction, predict power faults from telemetry, and perform adaptive data compression for low-bandwidth downlink. This framework was critical for autonomous and efficient satellite operation.

The electrical architecture was then designed through the power budget. The configuration and number of solar and battery cells were also identified.

Finally, due to time constraints, I created a basic 2U version of the 12U CubeSat to validate basic subsystem integration, mechanical constraints, and payload accommodation.
